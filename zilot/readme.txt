To compile this code :
>linux users
Make sure you got SDL2 installed, run make and execute the binary file

>windows users
You'll have to download an IDE, download SDL2, figure out how to set 
up SDL2 for your IDE and create a new project with my work


>IDE users
Linux users should use a custom makefile (already created) and won't have 
to worry about anything. 


>what's on those directories
background : images of the stage background (currently placeholders)
character : spritesheet and config files (currently placeholders)
header : header files of the project
src : source code of the project


all this is still work in progress. Maybe I should add more comments but
you can always ask in the /lit/ threads or discord. I'll lurk
